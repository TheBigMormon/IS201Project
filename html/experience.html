                        <p>I've been blessed with the opportunity at several jobs and organizations in my life. I learned constantly how to works and cooperate with other people and how to lead when needed. Throughout high school I was able to be a personal landscaper in which I performed labor in many of my neighbors yards. It was honestly very fun and I enjoyed getting to know them. I felt like it brought our community closer</p>
                        <p>My first job out of high school was a full-time student taking 16+ credits, but when I came home for a long winter break I was able to work at <a href="Evergreen Nursery" target="_blank">Evergreen Nursery</a>. I was a seasonal worker and was able to help people pick out their Christmas trees, cut them, net them, place a stand on them, and finaly load and tie them to their car. It was hard work, but very fulfilling and enjoyable.</p>
                        <p>Following my first year of college I worked on a top 100 public golf course for 6-7 months. Maderas Golf Course is where I learned a lot about how work enviroments can be frustrating. It seemed as everyone was at each others' throats all the time. But I stayed out of it and just learned to put my head down and work. Overall, was a good experience and allowed me to save enough money for my mission.</p>

                        <h2 class="sectmostion-heading">Boy Scouts of America</h2>
                        <p>As a Boy Scout of America I was able to earn over 30 merit badges. Each one had its own unique requirements and learning experiences. They were a lot of hard work, but I got to do cool things like small boat sailing! I met great people and developed great qualities that will benefit me in my future. I went camping often, built a makeshift shelter in the pouring rain with only two space blankets, and learned many other life skills. When I was Senior Patrol Leader I planned and worked hard to be organized and make each Boys Scout trip as much fun as possible. I loved teaching the younger scouts new skills and tips to an easier campout.</p>
